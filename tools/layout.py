"""Where hook trampolines live in the injected low-memory section.

Every patch is a set of hooks: one instruction in the game is replaced by a
branch to a small self-contained routine that runs the displaced instruction
and branches back.  A Gecko code handler stores those routines itself (C2
codes); the patched DOL and the Riivolution patch need somewhere to put them,
so the patcher adds one text section at CAVE_BASE.

0x80001800-0x80003000 is the Wii's boot-time scratch area, which the game itself
never touches (every access to 0x8000xxxx in the retail DOLs is at 0x80003000 or
above).  The first 0x20 bytes are skipped: the word at 0x80001800 is overwritten
by the OS early on.  Each feature gets a fixed window so the patches can be
combined freely.
